Welcome to FAED project
=======================

The main idea of this project is to use a drone to bring flying an automated electronic defibrillator (AED) where a cardiac emergency is happening. This drone will have a support platform with an easy extraction system in order to get the AED as fast as possible. But sideways the project is the base block for any kind of drone based distribution project.

The web site was created to highlight our ideas and promotion: http://www.faeddroneproject.com/

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp.git freecodecamp

cd freecodecamp

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Install Bower dependencies
bower install

# Create a .env file and populate it with the necessary API keys and secrets:
touch .env

```

Edit your .env file with the following API keys accordingly (if you only use email login, only the MONGOHQ_URL, SESSION_SECRET, MANDRILL_USER and MANDRILL_PASSWORD fields are necessary. Keep in mind if you want to use more services you'll have to get your own API keys for those services.
