Welcome to FAED project
=======================

The main idea of this project is to use a drone to bring flying an automated electronic defibrillator (AED) where a cardiac emergency is happening. This drone will have a support platform with an easy extraction system in order to get the AED as fast as possible. But sideways the project is the base block for any kind of drone based distribution project.

The web site was created to highlight our ideas and promotion: http://www.faeddroneproject.com/
